# NPM (Node Package Manager) – Understanding

NPM is the default package manager that comes with Node.js.
It is used to install, manage, and share JavaScript libraries.

- The tools that come built-in with Node.js are called core modules.
- The libraries that we download using NPM are called packages.

# Installing and Uninstalling Packages (Basics & Advanced)

### Installing a Package

To install any package, we use:

```
npm install <package-name>
```

or the short form:

```
npm i <package-name>
```

Example:

```
npm i one-liner-joke
```

### Uninstalling a Package

To remove a package from the project:

```
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

Example:

```
npm uninstall one-liner-joke
```

---

### Installing a Specific Version

Sometimes we need a specific version of a package:

```
npm i accessibility@6.1.0
```

### Uninstalling a Specific Package Version

Uninstalling works the same way:

```
npm uninstall accessibility
```

(NPM automatically removes the installed version.)

# Understanding node_modules

* The node_modules folder contains all installed packages.
* Every dependency and its sub-dependencies are stored here.
* This folder is auto-generated by NPM.
* We never edit this folder manually.

This folder is usually not uploaded to GitHub because it can be recreated using:

```
npm install
```

# Dependencies

Dependencies are the packages that are required for the application to run.

* They are needed in both development and production.
* These are listed inside the `dependencies` section of `package.json`.

Example:

```
npm i express
```

---

# DevDependencies

DevDependencies are packages used only during development.

* They help in testing, formatting, bundling, or development tools.
* They are not required after the application is built and deployed.

**Example:**

```
npm i nodemon --save-dev
```

or

```
npm i nodemon -D
```

They are listed inside the `devDependencies` section of `package.json`.

# Scripts – Understanding Default & Custom Scripts

The **scripts** section in `package.json` is used to define **commands** that run automatically.

---

## Default Scripts

### npm start

* This is a **special default script**.
* It runs without using `run`.
* Used to start the application.

Example:

```
npm start
```


## Custom Scripts

Custom scripts must be run using:

```
npm run <script-name>
```

### Example Scripts

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js",
  "concurrent": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
}
```

### npm run dev

* Commonly used in development.
* Runs tools like nodemon for auto-restart.

### npm run concurrent

* Runs multiple scripts at the same time.
* Often used to run frontend and backend together.
